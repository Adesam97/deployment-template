## deployment-templates for Google Cloud Platform(GCP) virtual machine provisioning


### To use the templates
You would typically create a YAML file with the contents of the templates that you want to use, and then use a deployment tool (such as the gcloud command-line tool or the Google Cloud Console) to create the resources defined in the YAML file.

Here are the high-level steps to use the templates:
- Create a YAML file that imports the templates and defines the resources that you want to create.
- Replace the placeholders such as <name>, <zone>, and MY_PROJECT in the templates with the actual values for your GCP project.
- Run the deployment tool to create the resources defined in the YAML file. For example, you could use the gcloud command-line tool to deploy the resources:
  
  <i>gcloud deployment-manager deployments create <deployment-name> --config <path-to-yaml-file></i>

 This command will create a new deployment in GCP with the name <deployment-name> and the resources defined in the YAML file located at <path-to-yaml-file>.

Note that this is a simple deployment template and there may be additional steps required depending on the specific resources you are creating and the configuration of your GCP project. Additionally, you may need to grant the deployment tool the necessary permissions to create resources in your GCP project.
